Try and Try Hard

If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start.

If you're going to try, go all the way. Thiscould mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives, jobs and maybe your mind. Goall the way.

It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision, mockery, isolation.

Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine.

If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that.
